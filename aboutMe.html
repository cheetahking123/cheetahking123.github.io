        I am into mathematics. 
        I was really satisfied after I solved a challenging question.
        I was the chairman of mathematics Club in secondary school.
        I have held a various activities to motivate my schoolmate's intereset to mathematics.
        When I went to polyU, I was happy to have AMA course.
        Although they are much more diffcult than what I have learnt before.
        I found that I can fully concentrate in AMA lessons. 
        Last semester, I have registrated a AMA course 
        which is called "The History of Ancient Chinese and World Mathematics".
        It is about the mathematics techniques of the ancient. 
        I have learnt so much fascinating alternatives to solve mathematics problems.
